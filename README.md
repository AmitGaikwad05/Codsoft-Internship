Codsoft internship projects in machine learning

Task-1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

Developed a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other information. We can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. The Data used in the task is taken from kaggle

Task-2: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Another ML model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics. Try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn. The Data used in the task is taken from kaggle

Task-3: SPAM SMS DETECTION

Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
